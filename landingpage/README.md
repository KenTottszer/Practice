This is my crack at a landingpage, focusing on flexbox. I struggled initially with my usage of flexbox in certain areas, and I still struggle with fully grasping the way certain commands interact with elements in a space. However, I know that as I continue my learning, and I practiced over and over again, I will feel more confident in my skillset.

Ez pedig az elso probam osszekombinalni HTML-t es CSS-t amellett a flexbora fokuszalas mellett.
